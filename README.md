Simple Ui for keeping simple records that my mother uses.

Technology used:

- nextjs
- tailwind
- react-query
- supabase
- react-pdf

not sure if I'll deploy, only using local dev setup

Used vim (neovim then switch to vscode-vim) to practice.

functionalities/features that I might add (not sure):

- User management
  - users can create records where they can assign access to other users
- better user interface and user experience
  - app animation with framer-motion
  - proper usage of react-query
